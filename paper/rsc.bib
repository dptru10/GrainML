	Abstract = {The piezoresistance effect of silicon1 has been widely used in mechanical sensors2--4, and is now being actively explored in order to improve the performance of silicon transistors5, 6. In fact, strain engineering is now considered to be one of the most promising strategies for developing high-performance sub-10-nm silicon devices7. Interesting electromechanical properties have been observed in carbon nanotubes8, 9. In this paper we report that Si nanowires possess an unusually large piezoresistance effect compared with bulk. For example, the longitudinal piezoresistance coefficient along the 〈111〉 direction increases with decreasing diameter for p-type Si nanowires, reaching as high as −3, 550 × 10−11 Pa−1, in comparison with a bulk value of −94 × 10−11 Pa−1. Straininduced carrier mobility change and surface modifications have been shown to have clear influence on piezoresistance coefficients. This giant piezoresistance effect in Si nanowires may have significant implications in nanowire-based flexible electronics, as well as in nanoelectromechanical systems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Zhang2013,
	Abstract = {Homogeneous interfaces like grain boundaries (GBs) play an important role in crystalline plasticity as they often serve as obstacles for dislocation motion, as well as dislocation sources/sinks. In the present work, microcompression experiments were carefully performed to uncover the effects of GBs on mechanical response of submicron-sized Cu multi-crystalline (MC) micropillars (containing several grains) by comparing with the single-crystalline (SC) samples at different strain rates. It is clearly demonstrated that, while the SC pillars suffer from intermittent and stochastic strain bursts, introducing GBs appropriately into the SC pillars can dramatically improve the smoothness of their plastic flow and enhance their strength and strain rate sensitivity (SRS), especially at greater strain rates. The presence of GBs can significantly suppress the strain bursts observed in the MC/SC Cu micropillars, which is simply quantified by considering the size and strain rate related-capacity of dislocation absorption by the GBs. These findings provide deep insights into the controllability of plastic deformation of small volume materials. The possible transition of strengthening mechanisms with plastic strain is also highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Han2016,
	Abstract = {Grain-boundary (GB) structure and properties are usually analyzed in terms of ground-state (minimum-energy) GB states. However, global equilibrium is rarely achieved in materials. In this paper, we investigate the nature of GB metastability and its impact on material properties. Higher-energy GB states can be the result of nonequilibrium processes or simply thermal excitations. While the existence of limited GB metastability is widely known for a few simple GBs, we demonstrate that the multiplicity of metastable GB states is, in general, very large. This conclusion is based upon extensive atomistic bicrystal simulations for both symmetric tilt GBs and twist GBs in three very different materials. The energies of these GB states are densely distributed so that the dependence of the GB energy on misorientation is better described as an energy band rather than as a single curve as in the traditional picture. Based upon the distribution of metastable GB states, we introduce a GB statistical-mechanics picture and apply it to predict finite-temperature equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties. When GB multiplicity exists, GB structures can be thought of as domains of different GB states separated by various classes of line defects. The existence of a large set of metastable GB states, very close in energy, suggests an analogy between the behaviors of GBs and glasses and implies the potential for GB engineering.},

	Abstract = {Three recently proposed constant temperature molecular dynamics methods by: (i) Nos{\'{e}} (Mol. Phys., to be published); (ii) Hoover et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1818 (1982)], and Evans and Morriss [Chem. Phys. 77, 63 (1983)]; and (iii) Haile and Gupta [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 3067 (1983)] are examined analytically via calculating the equilibrium distribution functions and comparing them with that of the canonical ensemble. Except for effects due to momentum and angular momentum conservation, method (i) yields the rigorous canonical distribution in both momentum and coordinate space. Method (ii) can be made rigorous in coordinate space, and can be derived from method (i) by imposing a specific constraint. Method (iii) is not rigorous and gives a deviation of order N -1/2 from the canonical distribution (N the number of particles). The results for the constant temperature-constant pressure ensemble are similar to the canonical ensemble case. {\textcopyright} 1984 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Hoover1985,
	Abstract = {Nos{\'{e}} has modified Newtonian dynamics so as to reproduce both the canonical and the isothermal-isobaric probability densities in the phase space of an N-body system. He did this by scaling time (with s) and distance (with V1/D in D dimensions) through Lagrangian equations of motion. The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, , and , where the x are reduced distances and the two variables and act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator. {\textcopyright} 1985 The American Physical Society.},
